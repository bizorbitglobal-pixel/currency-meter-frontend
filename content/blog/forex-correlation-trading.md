**Introduction**

Correlation is the silent killer of overconfident traders.  
You think you’re diversified — but your trades are all tied to the same theme.

Cross-check correlations at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### Understanding It

Pairs like EUR/USD and GBP/USD usually move together because both share USD.  
Trading both doubles your exposure, not your opportunity.

### Application

1. Use correlation matrix weekly.  
2. Avoid stacking positions with >80% correlation.  
3. Mix pairs from different regions to balance exposure.

### Smart Workflow

Strength meter → correlation check → final selection.  
That’s how pros manage both opportunity *and* risk.
