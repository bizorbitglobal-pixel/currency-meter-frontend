**Introduction**

If strength-based trading isn’t working, it’s usually not the tool — it’s the **process**. Here are the pitfalls we see most often and how to fix them quickly.

Learn robust workflows at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### Mistake 1: Timeframe mismatch

Scanning on daily but executing on M1 makes noise feel like signal. Align bias (D1/H4) with execution (H1/M15) so the story stays consistent.

### Mistake 2: Trading every extreme

A top- or bottom-ranked currency is a **filter**, not an automatic entry. Marry strength to meaningful price levels: prior swing highs/lows, supply/demand, session opens.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring news

A perfect setup can fail in two seconds on CPI or NFP. Either stand down near releases or reduce risk and wait for post-news structure to form.

### Mistake 4: Poor data hygiene

Use a meter that updates reliably and normalizes across pairs. Stale or lagging data produces false comfort.

### Mistake 5: No exit logic

Define take-profit rules (fixed R, trailing, partials). A good entry isn’t enough without a consistent exit.

### Fix it fast

Write a 1-page playbook: bias rules, entry trigger, stop placement, exit method, news filter. Then repeat it until it’s boring — that’s consistency.
