### What Are Cross Pairs?

Pairs that don’t involve the USD — like EUR/GBP, AUD/JPY, GBP/CHF.

### Advantages

- Unique trends during risk shifts.  
- Lower correlation to U.S. data.  
- Often react faster to regional events.

### Tip

When two strong currencies meet, expect choppiness.  
Pair strong vs. weak — always.
