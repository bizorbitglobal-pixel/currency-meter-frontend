**Introduction**

Swing trading is the calm middle ground between scalping chaos and long-term patience.  
It’s about catching *swings* that last days, not minutes.

Framework templates at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### Process Overview

1. Use the **strength meter** to find directional bias.  
2. Analyze **daily trend structure**.  
3. Drop to **4H for entry timing**.  
4. Risk small, aim for 2R–3R targets.

### Why It Works

Because you trade when others sleep — fewer fakeouts, more clarity.
