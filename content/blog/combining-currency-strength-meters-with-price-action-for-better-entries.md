## Introduction

While currency strength meters provide valuable data, combining them with **price action** creates a stronger, confirmation-based trading approach.

## How to Combine

1. Look for Confirming Signals  
2. Use Support and Resistance Levels  
3. Identify Trend Reversals  
4. Confirm Candlestick Patterns  

## Example

If GBP shows strong momentum while USD weakens, and you spot a bullish engulfing candle on GBP/USD â€” this creates a powerful entry setup.

## Conclusion

Pairing currency strength with price action helps traders enter with precision and confidence.
