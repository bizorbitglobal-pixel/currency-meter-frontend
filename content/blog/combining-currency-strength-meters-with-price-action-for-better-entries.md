**Introduction**

While currency strength meters provide valuable data, combining them with **price action** creates a stronger, confirmation-based trading approach.

**How to Combine**

1. Look for Confirming Signals  
2. Use Support and Resistance Levels  
3. Identify Trend Reversals  
4. Confirm Candlestick Patterns  

**Example**

If GBP shows strong momentum while USD weakens, and you spot a bullish engulfing candle on GBP/USD â€” this creates a powerful entry setup.
