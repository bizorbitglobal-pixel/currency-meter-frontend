**Introduction**

It’s not just what you trade — it’s what you *pay* to trade.  
Spreads and slippage silently eat profits if you don’t manage them smartly.

Learn execution optimization at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### Understanding Spread

The **spread** is the difference between bid and ask.  
Tight spreads save you money; wide spreads punish poor timing.

### Slippage Reality

Slippage happens when price moves before your order executes — usually during high volatility or low liquidity.  
It’s normal, but controllable.

### How to Minimize It

1. Trade during **major sessions** (London/NY).  
2. Avoid **news spikes** unless you’re a pro.  
3. Use **limit orders** instead of market orders when possible.  
4. Choose **regulated brokers** with solid infrastructure.

### Insight

Many traders chase small pips but ignore execution drag — that’s like running with weights on. Remove friction and your system instantly improves.
