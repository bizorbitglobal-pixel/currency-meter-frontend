**Introduction**

Every chart has a heartbeat, and that rhythm comes from **support and resistance**.  
Combine these key levels with a **currency strength meter**, and you’ll know *where* and *when* to act — not just why.

You’ll find live chart examples at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### The Basics

Support is where buyers step in; resistance is where sellers defend.  
But here’s the catch: they’re zones, not exact lines. Treat them like areas of interest, not single-price magnets.

### How to Identify Zones

- Look left — previous swing highs/lows.  
- Watch reaction clusters (wick rejections).  
- Mark round numbers (psychological levels).

### Combine with Strength

If EUR shows strong and USD weak, check EUR/USD approaching resistance. A clean breakout plus strength alignment often starts a new leg.

### Common Mistakes

- Treating levels as guaranteed reversals.  
- Ignoring timeframe context.  
- Forgetting that strong trends break levels like paper.
