**Introduction**

Correlation measures how pairs move relative to each other. If you’re long EUR/USD and long GBP/USD, you may be **double long** the euro–dollar theme without realizing it. Combine correlation awareness with strength to avoid crowded risk.

Check correlation tables alongside live strength at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### Practical use

- **High positive correlation**: avoid taking multiple positions that effectively express the same macro view.  
- **Negative correlation**: can serve as hedge or diversification (but still manage risk per trade).  
- **Dynamic correlation**: it changes — review weekly.

### Simple workflow

1. Use the **strength meter** to choose candidates.  
2. Check a **correlation matrix** so you’re not duplicating exposure.  
3. Size positions with the **whole portfolio** in mind, not each trade in isolation.

### Example

EUR and GBP both strong vs. USD. Instead of buying both EUR/USD and GBP/USD, pick the cleaner chart or split risk. If JPY is weak, consider a cross like EUR/JPY or GBP/JPY to diversify USD exposure.

### Takeaway

Strength finds opportunities; correlation keeps you safe. Use both for professional-grade risk control.
