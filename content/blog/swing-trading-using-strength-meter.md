**Introduction**

Swing trading aims to capture **multi-day** moves with fewer decisions and more patience. A currency strength meter helps you select pairs that have a tailwind, so you’re not fighting chop.

Daily strength overviews are available on [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### Framework

1. **Bias (D1)** — build your watchlist from top vs. bottom currencies.  
2. **Structure (H4)** — confirm trend (higher highs/lows or lower highs/lows).  
3. **Entry (H1)** — pullback to prior level or moving average; candle confirmation.  
4. **Management** — partials at structure targets; trail stop behind swing points.

### Example

Meter shows **AUD rising** for several sessions; **JPY weakening** broadly. AUD/JPY on H4 forms higher lows; H1 pulls back to a demand zone and prints a bullish rejection. Enter with stop below the zone; target prior H4 high first, then trail.

### Why it works

- You let time do the heavy lifting.  
- Strength alignment reduces dead time in ranges.  
- You avoid overtrading; quality > quantity.

### Closing thought

Swing trading rewards patience and respect for bias. Trust the process; let the market pay you for waiting.
