**Introduction**

Volatility is like fire — handled right, it’s useful; handled wrong, it burns.  
A strong **trading plan** adapts position size and strategy to volatility levels.

Adaptive planning templates at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### Three Volatility States

1. **Low Volatility:** Range trades, small stops, quicker exits.  
2. **Moderate Volatility:** Swing setups, normal position sizing.  
3. **High Volatility:** Trend continuations only, half risk.

### Tools to Gauge It

- **ATR (Average True Range)**  
- **Session timing** (London vs. Asia)  
- **Meter movement speed**

### Plan Tip

When ATR doubles, halve your position. You’ll sleep better and last longer.
