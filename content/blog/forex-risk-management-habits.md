**Introduction**

There’s a saying in trading circles: *“Amateurs look for entry signals, professionals look for risk.”*

### Why Habits Matter

Discipline doesn’t appear overnight. It’s built through systems — routines you can repeat even when emotion takes over.  
The problem? Many traders treat risk management as an afterthought. In reality, it’s the *first* decision before any trade.

### Core Habits to Master

1. **Set fixed risk per trade.**  
   Professionals rarely risk more than 1%–2%. That small number is what lets them survive losing streaks.

2. **Always predefine stop loss.**  
   A “mental stop” isn’t real — it’s a wish. Put your stop in the market.

3. **Align position size with volatility.**  
   If ATR doubles, your lot size halves. Volatile pairs deserve smaller bets.

4. **Never move stops away.**  
   The only valid stop adjustment is to *reduce* risk.

### Example

Let’s say your meter shows EUR strong, JPY weak — perfect setup.  
You still use a consistent 1% risk, even if you’re “sure.” Over time, that discipline compounds far more than luck ever will.
