**Introduction**

Support and resistance are fundamental tools for forex traders. They help pinpoint potential entry and exit zones by identifying where price tends to stall or reverse.

### What Are Support and Resistance?

- **Support:** A level where price often stops falling and may bounce upward.  
- **Resistance:** A ceiling where price struggles to move higher.

### How to Draw Them

Use swing highs and lows, round numbers, and previous price reactions. Combine with moving averages or Fibonacci levels for stronger confirmation.

### Trading Strategies

1. **Bounce Strategy:** Enter trades when price respects support/resistance.  
2. **Breakout Strategy:** Trade after price breaks through a key level.  
3. **Retest Strategy:** Wait for a pullback to confirm breakout validity.

### Tips for Accuracy

- Use multiple timeframes.  
- Confirm with strength meters or momentum indicators.  
- Avoid placing trades directly on news events.

**Conclusion**

Mastering support and resistance allows traders to find precise entries with favorable risk-to-reward ratiosâ€”essential for consistent forex success.
