**Introduction**

Currency pairs often move in relation to one another. This relationship — known as **correlation** — helps traders manage risk and improve diversification.

### What Is Correlation?

Correlation measures how two pairs move together.  
- **Positive correlation:** EUR/USD and GBP/USD often move in the same direction.  
- **Negative correlation:** USD/JPY and EUR/USD tend to move oppositely.

### Why It Matters

Ignoring correlation can double your exposure. If you buy both EUR/USD and GBP/USD, you’re essentially betting twice against the USD.

### How to Use It

1. Check correlation matrices weekly.  
2. Avoid overexposure to one currency.  
3. Hedge trades by pairing negatively correlated pairs.

### Bonus Tip

Combine correlation data with strength meters to validate currency bias across multiple pairs.

**Conclusion**

Understanding correlation transforms trading from guessing to calculated positioning. It’s an essential step in professional risk management.
