**Introduction**

Price action trading focuses on pure price movement — no indicators, just clean charts. It’s a preferred method for professional forex traders.

### What Is Price Action?

It’s the study of historical price behavior to predict future moves. Traders read candlestick patterns, breakouts, and rejections to spot entries.

### Key Price Action Patterns

1. **Pin Bar:** Reversal signal showing rejection.  
2. **Engulfing Candle:** Strong trend reversal indicator.  
3. **Inside Bar:** Breakout or consolidation pattern.

### How to Trade Price Action

- Identify market trend and structure.  
- Wait for a clear pattern at key support or resistance levels.  
- Confirm with higher timeframe trend.

### Bonus Tip

Combine **price action** with a **currency strength meter** to confirm momentum before entering trades.

**Conclusion**

Price action is timeless. It simplifies charts, sharpens decision-making, and delivers powerful results when practiced with patience and consistency.
