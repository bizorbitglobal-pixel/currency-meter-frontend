**Introduction**

Ask ten traders if they’re “technical” or “fundamental,” and you’ll get ten passionate answers.  
Truth is, you don’t need to choose — you just need to know *when* each matters most.

You’ll find blended analysis frameworks on [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### Fundamentals

These move markets.  
Interest rates, employment data, inflation — the big macro themes shape strength and weakness across currencies.

### Technicals

These refine timing.  
Charts reveal crowd behavior and entry opportunities that fundamentals alone can’t pinpoint.

### How Pros Combine Both

- **Fundamentals** define bias.  
- **Strength meters** quantify it.  
- **Technicals** execute it.

Example: If central banks turn hawkish on GBP, the meter will reflect GBP strength days or weeks before headlines fade. Combine that with clean chart structure, and you have an edge.
