**Introduction**

Trend is your trading compass. The **currency strength meter** reveals momentum; combining it with trend structure confirms direction.

Access trend dashboards at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### Trend Confirmation

- **Higher highs & higher lows** → Uptrend  
- **Lower highs & lower lows** → Downtrend  
- **Sideways** → Avoid until clear breakout

### Combining Tools

Use strength readings for macro bias, then confirm with 50 EMA or price structure.  
Example: If GBP strong, USD weak, and GBP/USD is above EMA 50 — buy pullbacks.

### Summary

Trade with the flow, not against it. Trends pay; countertrends punish.
