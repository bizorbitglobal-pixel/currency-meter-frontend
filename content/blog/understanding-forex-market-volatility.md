**Introduction**

Volatility is what makes forex exciting — and risky. Understanding how and when prices move helps traders manage risk and find better opportunities.

### What Is Volatility?

Volatility measures how much a currency’s price fluctuates.  
- **High volatility:** Large, rapid price changes (good for short-term traders).  
- **Low volatility:** Small, stable moves (good for swing traders).

### Causes of Volatility

- Economic announcements  
- Central bank interest rate changes  
- Political events  
- Market sentiment shifts  

### How to Trade Volatility

1. **Use Stop-Loss Orders:** Protect capital from sudden swings.  
2. **Trade Volatile Sessions:** London and New York overlaps offer best moves.  
3. **Adjust Lot Size:** Reduce position size during high-risk periods.  

**Pro Tip**

Use a **Currency Strength Meter** to identify which pairs are driving volatility.  

**Conclusion**

Understanding volatility gives traders control. Rather than fearing market spikes, learn to harness them for strategic opportunities.
