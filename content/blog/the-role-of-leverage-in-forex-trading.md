**Introduction**

Leverage allows traders to control larger positions with smaller deposits. However, misuse can magnify losses.

### How Leverage Works

A 1:100 leverage ratio means $100 controls $10,000 worth of currency.  
While this boosts profits, it increases risk.

### Tips

- Use lower leverage for volatile pairs.  
- Combine with stop-loss protection.  
- Monitor margin level carefully.
