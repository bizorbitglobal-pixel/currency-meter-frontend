**Introduction**

Understanding **market sentiment** gives you context behind price movement. When you combine a **currency strength meter** with sentiment tools, you get both *what is happening* and *why*.  
To learn more about integrating sentiment into your trading, visit [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### What Sentiment Really Is

Sentiment represents the crowd’s emotional bias — optimism or pessimism — toward a currency or pair.  
If most traders are long EUR/USD and price is still falling, it means **smart money** is likely positioned the opposite way.

### Types of Sentiment Tools

1. **Commitment of Traders (COT) Reports** — reveal institutional long/short positions.  
2. **Retail Positioning Data** — shows where retail traders are overexposed.  
3. **News Sentiment Scanners** — track tone across headlines and Twitter feeds.  
4. **Fear & Greed Indexes** — measure broad risk appetite.

### Combining Strength and Sentiment

- Use the **strength meter** to detect flow.  
- Use **sentiment** to validate or fade that flow.  
- Example: If USD is strong but sentiment shows excessive bullishness, prepare for possible reversal.

### Takeaway

Markets are powered by emotion and liquidity. Sentiment lets you understand emotion; the strength meter shows liquidity. Together, they form a more complete market map.
