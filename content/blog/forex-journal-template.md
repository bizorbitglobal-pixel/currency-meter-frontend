**Introduction**

You can’t improve what you don’t measure.  
A **forex trading journal** is the most underrated tool in a trader’s arsenal — even more useful than any indicator.

### Why Journaling Works

It externalizes your thinking. You start to *see* your patterns — revenge trades, hesitation, or overconfidence.  
That awareness changes everything.

### What to Log

- Pair, bias (based on strength meter)  
- Entry/Exit rationale  
- Screenshot before & after  
- Emotional state (calm, rushed, confident, bored)  
- Result in R multiple

### Review Routine

Once a week, review all trades.  
Ask: “Did I follow my plan?” not “Did I make money?”  
Improvements come from process reflection, not profit obsession.

### Tip

Add color coding: green for perfect execution, yellow for sloppy but acceptable, red for broken rules. Visuals motivate consistency.
