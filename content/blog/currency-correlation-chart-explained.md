**Introduction**

A **currency correlation chart** shows how different forex pairs move in relation to each other — a vital tool for controlling exposure and improving portfolio balance.

### Understanding Correlation

- **Positive Correlation:** Pairs move in the same direction (EUR/USD & GBP/USD).  
- **Negative Correlation:** Pairs move oppositely (USD/JPY & EUR/USD).  
- **Zero Correlation:** No consistent relationship.

### How to Use It

1. Avoid trading multiple pairs with high positive correlation.  
2. Hedge risk by pairing positively and negatively correlated positions.  
3. Combine correlation data with strength meters for clearer direction.

**Conclusion**

Correlation charts prevent overexposure and duplication of risk — essential for professional money management in forex.
