**Introduction**

In forex, every trade involves two currenciesâ€”one strong, one weak. Understanding **currency strength** helps traders choose pairs with the highest probability of trending moves.

### What Is Currency Strength?

Currency strength measures a currencyâ€™s performance relative to others. For instance, if USD is strong and JPY is weak, USD/JPY tends to rise.

### Why Itâ€™s Important

- **Improved Trade Selection:** Pairing the strongest and weakest currencies enhances momentum.  
- **Market Confirmation:** Confirms technical trends before entering trades.  
- **Reduced Noise:** Filters sideways or uncertain markets.

### Tools to Measure Strength

- **Currency Strength Meters** (like yours ðŸ˜‰)  
- **Heatmaps**  
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**  
- **Moving-Average Comparisons**

### Practical Example

If the EUR strengthens due to strong Eurozone data while GBP weakens after poor UK news, a **EUR/GBP buy trade** might present a clear opportunity.

**Conclusion**

Tracking currency strength provides clarity in a volatile market. Use it with technical and fundamental tools to confirm high-probability setups.
