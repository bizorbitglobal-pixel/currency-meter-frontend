**Introduction**

Candlesticks tell the story of fear and greed — one bar at a time.  
When read alongside a **currency strength meter**, they reveal where money is quietly rotating.

Explore candle guides at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### Key Patterns

- **Bullish engulfing:** shift from sellers to buyers.  
- **Pin bar:** rejection with strong wick.  
- **Inside bar:** low volatility pause before breakout.  
- **Doji:** indecision — watch what follows.

### Using Them with Strength

Don’t trade candles in isolation.  
If GBP is strong and you see a bullish engulfing on GBP/USD — that’s conviction.  
If the meter disagrees, skip the setup.

### Final Word

Reading candlesticks is like learning a language. The market always speaks — you just have to slow down and listen.
