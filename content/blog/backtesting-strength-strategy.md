**Introduction**

Before you scale risk, **prove the edge**. Backtesting a currency strength approach shows whether your logic actually worked historically — and how volatile the equity curve might be.

### Data and rules

- Choose at least **6–12 months** of historical data.  
- Define **precise rules** (bias, entry, stop, exit, filters).  
- Record **every** trade that meets criteria — no discretion.

### Metrics that matter

- **Win rate** (but watch **R multiple** too).  
- **Average win vs. loss** (expectancy).  
- **Max drawdown** (your psychological pain threshold).  
- **Time in trade** (helps refine targets).

### Improve the system

- Add a **news filter** for major releases.  
- Test **EMA filter** or **RSI threshold** to avoid exhaustion.  
- Try **partial exits** vs. **full exits** to see which compounds better.

### Final note

Backtesting won’t predict the future, but it will make you honest. Honesty is the foundation of scalable risk.
