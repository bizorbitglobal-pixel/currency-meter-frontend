**Introduction**

New to forex? This guide simplifies everything you need to start trading currencies confidently—from setting up your first account to understanding trade execution.

### Step 1: Understand the Market

Forex involves simultaneous buying and selling of currencies. For example, buying EUR/USD means buying euros and selling U.S. dollars. Traders speculate on price movements driven by **economic data**, **interest rates**, and **market sentiment**.

### Step 2: Choose a Reputable Broker

Look for:  
- **Regulation** by authorities (FCA, ASIC, NFA).  
- **Low spreads** and **fast execution**.  
- **Demo account** for practice.

### Step 3: Develop a Trading Plan

Include risk per trade (1–2%), profit targets, and clear entry/exit rules. A plan keeps emotions in check during volatile markets.

### Step 4: Learn Technical & Fundamental Analysis

- **Technical:** Candlestick patterns, support/resistance, indicators.  
- **Fundamental:** Economic reports, central-bank policies, and geopolitical news.

**Conclusion**

Consistency beats intensity in forex. Start small, trade a demo, and grow your knowledge before scaling capital.
