**Introduction**

Winning traders don’t just predict price — they control **risk**.  
The **currency strength meter** shows where to trade; **risk management** ensures you live to trade tomorrow.

Practical guides are at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### Defining Risk–Reward

A 1:2 ratio means risking 1% to earn 2%. You can lose half your trades and still grow.  
Always define risk *before* entry.

### Risk Rules

- Never risk more than 2% per trade.  
- Set stops behind logical structure, not arbitrary pips.  
- Avoid overlapping correlated positions.

### Reward Principles

Trade **strong vs. weak** to maximize distance potential — this naturally improves reward ratios.

### Mindset

Think in series, not trades. Consistency matters more than perfection.
