**Introduction**

The safest trades happen **with the trend**, not at random highs and lows.  
A **pullback** lets you join momentum at a discount — the strength meter helps confirm when that pullback is ready to resume.

Tutorials available at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### Step Plan

1. Identify trend via EMA or structure.  
2. Wait for pullback into prior demand/supply.  
3. Confirm strength still favors your direction.  
4. Enter with low risk and high precision.

### Tools

- EMA 20/50  
- RSI 50 midline  
- Strength meter ranking consistency

**Conclusion**

Pullbacks are where professionals load — not chase. Follow the data, not emotion.
