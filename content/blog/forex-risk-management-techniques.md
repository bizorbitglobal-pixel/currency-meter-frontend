## Why Risk Management is Non-Negotiable

In forex trading, you cannot control the market. You cannot control the news, the central banks, or the liquidity providers. The **only** thing you can control is your **risk**.

Risk management is the set of rules and measures you put in place to ensure that a losing streak does not wipe out your trading account. It is what separates professional traders from gamblers.

## Core Principles of Risk Management

### 1. The 1% Rule
This is the golden rule of trading. **Never risk more than 1% to 2% of your account balance on a single trade.**

*   **Account Balance:** $10,000
*   **Max Risk per Trade:** $100 (1%)

This ensures that even if you lose 10 trades in a row, you still have nearly 90% of your capital left to fight another day. If you risk 10% per trade, a losing streak of 5 trades would deplete 50% of your account, which requires a 100% gain just to break even!

### 2. Stop-Loss Orders are Mandatory
A **Stop-Loss (SL)** is an order that automatically closes your trade if the price moves against you directly by a certain amount.

**Never execute a trade without a predefined Stop-Loss.**
*   Mental stop-losses often fail due to emotional hesitation. "I'll close it if it goes lower" often turns into "It will bounce back soon," leading to catastrophic losses.
*   Place your SL at a technical invalidation point (e.g., below a support level), not just an arbitrary number of pips.

### 3. Risk-to-Reward Ratio (R:R)
Your **Reward** (profit target) should always be larger than your **Risk**. A common benchmark is **1:2** or higher.

*   **Risk:** $100
*   **Target:** $200

With a 1:2 R:R, you can win only 40% of your trades and still be profitable.
*   10 Trades. 4 Wins ($200 * 4 = $800). 6 Losses ($100 * 6 = $600).
*   **Net Profit:** $200.

## Advanced Risk Management Techniques

### Position Sizing
Don't trade the same lot size for every trade. Adjust your lot size based on your Stop Loss distance to maintain that 1% risk.
*   **Trade A (SL 20 pips):** Larger lot size allowed.
*   **Trade B (SL 50 pips):** Smaller lot size required.

Use a **Position Size Calculator** before every trade.

### Correlation Awareness
Avoid taking multiple trades in the same direction on highly correlated pairs (e.g., Long EUR/USD and Long GBP/USD).
If the US Dollar strengthens, both trades will likely hit their stop loss simultaneously, effectively doubling your risk on a single market event.

### Break-Even Stops
Once a trade moves in your favor by a certain amount (e.g., 1:1 R:R), move your Stop Loss to your entry price. This creates a "risk-free trade." Even if the market reverses, you lose nothing (except spread/commissions).

## Psychological Aspects of Risk
Risk management is also about managing your emotions.
*   **Avoid Revenge Trading:** After a loss, do not increase your risk to "make it back." Stick to the plan.
*   **Avoid Overtrading:** Taking too many setup-less trades increases exposure to market noise.

## Conclusion

The goal of trading is not just to make money, but to **keep** the money you make. By strictly adhering to risk management principles like the 1% rule and maintaining a positive Risk-to-Reward ratio, you ensure your survival and long-term success in the forex market.
