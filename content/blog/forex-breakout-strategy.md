**Introduction**

Breakouts are where the market finally commits.  
Catching them early without chasing requires structure and confirmation.

Step-by-step guides at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### How to Trade Breakouts

1. Identify compression zones.  
2. Watch for volume expansion.  
3. Confirm with **strength alignment**.  
4. Retest → enter → trail stop.

### Caution

Most breakouts fail because traders jump in too soon.  
Wait for the candle close beyond the level — patience turns chaos into clarity.
