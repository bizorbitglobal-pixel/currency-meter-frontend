**Introduction**

Volume tells you whether price movement has real participation behind it.  
In forex, true centralized volume doesn’t exist — but **tick volume** still reveals strong hints.

Explore volume overlays at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### How to Read Volume

- **Rising volume + rising price** → strong trend continuation.  
- **Rising volume + falling price** → heavy selling pressure.  
- **Falling volume + breakout** → suspect move, possible trap.

### Strength + Volume Combo

If your strength meter shows EUR gaining and volume spikes on EUR/USD rallies — that’s confirmation.  
If volume fades, expect exhaustion.

### Pro Tip

Volume confirms intent; price confirms execution. Use both.
