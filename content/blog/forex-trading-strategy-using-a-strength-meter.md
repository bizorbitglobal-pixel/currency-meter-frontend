## The Power of Relative Strength

Most new traders focus on a single pair, like EUR/USD, and try to predict its direction in isolation. A **Currency Strength Meter** changes this perspective. It allows you to see the entire market at a glance and identify which individual currencies are driving price action.

The core philosophy of this strategy is simple: **Buy Strength, Sell Weakness.**

## The Strategy: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Identify the Outliers
Open your Currency Strength Meter (available live on our homepage). You are looking for the extremes.
*   **Strongest Currency:** The bar with the highest value (e.g., USD).
*   **Weakest Currency:** The bar with the lowest value (e.g., JPY).

**Action:** Pair them together. In this case, you would look to **Buy USD/JPY**.
*Why?* You have one currency pushing the price up and the other pulling it down (or offering no resistance), creating a strong trend.

### Step 2: Check the Timeframes
A strength meter often shows real-time or short-term strength. Ensure this aligns with the higher timeframe trend.
*   If the Meter says "Buy GBP/AUD", check the H4 or Daily chart of GBP/AUD.
*   Is it in an uptrend? **Confluence found.**
*   Is it hitting major resistance? **Caution warranted.**

### Step 3: Wait for a Pullback (Entry)
Do not incite FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) and jump in immediately. Even strong trends have pullbacks.
*   Switch to a lower timeframe (e.g., M15 or H1).
*   Wait for price to retrace to a Moving Average (e.g., 20 EMA) or a local support level.
*   Enter when price action shows signs of resuming the trend (e.g., a bullish engulfing candle).

### Step 4: Set Stop Loss and Take Profit
*   **Stop Loss:** Place it below the recent swing low of the pullback.
*   **Take Profit:** Target the next major resistance level or use a trailing stop to ride the trend.

## Example Trade Scenario

**Market Context:**
*   **AUD** is at 8.5 (Very Strong) due to positive economic data.
*   **CAD** is at 2.1 (Weak) due to falling oil prices.

**The Pair:** AUD/CAD.

**Execution:**
1.  **Chart Check:** AUD/CAD Daily chart shows a clean break of resistance.
2.  **Entry:** On the 1-hour chart, price dips to the 50 MA.
3.  **Trigger:** A hammer candle forms on the 50 MA.
4.  **Action:** BUY AUD/CAD.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1.  **Trading Flat Markets:** If all bars on the meter are roughly equal (e.g., everyone is between 4 and 6), the market is ranging. This strategy works best for **Trending Markets**, not ranging ones. Stay on the sidelines.
2.  **Ignoring News:** high-impact news (like Non-Farm Payrolls) can flip currency strength in seconds. Avoid entering new trades just before major red-folder events.
3.  **Blindly Following the Meter:** The meter is a snapshot of *now*. Always double-check technical analysis on the charts.

## Conclusion

Using a Currency Strength Meter filters out the noise. Instead of scanning 20 charts, you can instantly narrow down your focus to the top 2 or 3 pairs with the highest probability of moving. Combine this "Strong vs. Weak" approach with sound technical analysis, and you have a robust trading edge.
