**Introduction**

A **forex strength meter** is one of the simplest yet most powerful tools for identifying profitable currency pairs. It helps traders align with the market’s real momentum.

### Step 1: Identify Strong vs. Weak Currencies

Look for one currency at the top (strong) and one at the bottom (weak) of the meter.  
**Example:** If USD is strong and JPY is weak, look for long opportunities in USD/JPY.

### Step 2: Confirm with Technical Analysis

Combine strength data with chart patterns or indicators like RSI and moving averages for validation.

### Step 3: Execute and Manage Risk

- Use stop-loss below support levels.  
- Target realistic take-profit zones.  
- Avoid trades during news spikes.

**Conclusion**

Trading the strongest vs. weakest pairs using a strength meter increases accuracy, reduces noise, and enhances timing in forex trades.
