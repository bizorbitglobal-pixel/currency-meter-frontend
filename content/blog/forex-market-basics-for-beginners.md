**Introduction**

The forex market—short for *foreign exchange*—is where currencies are bought and sold. With over **$7 trillion** traded daily, it’s the world’s largest and most liquid financial market. For beginners, understanding how this global market functions is the first step toward profitable trading.

### What Is the Forex Market?

The forex market connects banks, institutions, and individual traders worldwide. Instead of a physical exchange, it operates electronically through a network of participants who trade currency pairs such as **EUR/USD**, **GBP/JPY**, or **AUD/CAD**.

### Why Trade Forex?

- **Liquidity:** Always-available buyers and sellers.  
- **24-Hour Access:** Open five days a week across global sessions.  
- **Low Costs:** Tight spreads and minimal commissions.  
- **Leverage:** Small capital can control larger positions (use responsibly).

### Key Concepts

- **Currency Pairs:** Base vs. quote currency (EUR/USD = 1.1000 means €1 = $1.10).  
- **Pip:** The smallest price unit, typically 0.0001.  
- **Lot:** Standard trade size (1 lot = 100 000 units).  
- **Bid/Ask:** Buying and selling prices set by brokers.  

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Over-leveraging trades.  
- Ignoring news events and economic calendars.  
- Trading without a stop-loss.  

**Conclusion**

Mastering forex basics builds a foundation for long-term success. Learn the language of currencies, stay disciplined, and practice risk management before moving to live trading.
