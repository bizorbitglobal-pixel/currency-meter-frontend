**Introduction**

Trade management separates beginners from pros.  
Entries are easy; managing what happens after is where mastery lies.

See management case studies at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### Key Tactics

1. **Trail stops** under structure, not arbitrary pips.  
2. **Scale out** partial profits to reduce pressure.  
3. **Let winners breathe** — the market needs room to move.  
4. **Accept scratch trades** — small losses protect capital.

### Mindset Shift

Focus on **process over outcome**.  
Once risk is locked, emotion disappears — and consistency enters.
