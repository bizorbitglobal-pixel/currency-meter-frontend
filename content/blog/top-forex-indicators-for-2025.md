**Introduction**

Forex traders rely on indicators to analyze price data and forecast future movements. But with hundreds of tools available, knowing which ones truly work is crucial.

### 1. Moving Averages (MA)

Simple and exponential moving averages help identify trends and filter out market noise.  
**Tip:** Use crossover strategies (e.g., 50 MA & 200 MA).

### 2. Relative Strength Index (RSI)

RSI measures momentum between 0 and 100.  
- Overbought: Above 70  
- Oversold: Below 30  

### 3. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

Shows trend direction and momentum using moving averages.  
**Watch for crossovers** as entry signals.

### 4. Currency Strength Meter

Shows which currencies are gaining or losing power in real-time.  
**Combine with RSI** for confirmation.

### 5. Bollinger Bands

Measure volatility and breakout potential. Tight bands often precede sharp moves.

**Conclusion**

Focus on 2â€“3 reliable indicators rather than cluttering charts. Mastering fewer tools leads to cleaner analysis and higher confidence.
