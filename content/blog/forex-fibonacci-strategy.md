**Introduction**

Fibonacci levels are one of the oldest and most respected tools in trading.  
When combined with a **currency strength meter**, they create a synergy between math and momentum.

For chart examples, visit [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### Core Levels

- 38.2% — shallow pullback, strong trend.  
- 50% — balanced retracement.  
- 61.8% — deep pullback, high reward if trend resumes.

### The Blend Setup

1. Identify trend direction using strength meter.  
2. Plot Fibonacci retracement on the latest swing.  
3. Look for confluence at 50–61.8% zone.  
4. Confirm with candle rejection or momentum return.

### Why It Works

Because Fibonacci measures crowd behavior — and human behavior repeats.
