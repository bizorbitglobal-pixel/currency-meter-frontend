**Introduction**

Forex operates 24 hours a day — but not all hours are created equal. Each global **trading session** has its own characteristics, volatility, and opportunities.

### Major Forex Sessions

1. **Sydney Session (10 PM–7 AM GMT):** Quietest, sets early tone.  
2. **Tokyo Session (12 AM–9 AM GMT):** Yen-focused moves begin.  
3. **London Session (8 AM–5 PM GMT):** Highest liquidity and volume.  
4. **New York Session (1 PM–10 PM GMT):** Strong volatility overlaps London hours.

### Why Session Timing Matters

- Liquidity varies with each session.  
- Currency pairs behave differently (e.g., USD/JPY in Tokyo vs. EUR/USD in London).  
- Overlaps offer best trading conditions.

### Best Times to Trade

- **London–New York Overlap:** Maximum activity.  
- **Avoid:** Low-volatility hours before market close.

**Conclusion**

Timing is key in forex. Understanding sessions helps traders match their strategy with periods of maximum liquidity and predictable volatility.
