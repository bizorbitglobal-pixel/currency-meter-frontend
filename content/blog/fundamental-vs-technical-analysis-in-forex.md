**Introduction**

Every trader must decide whether to base trades on **fundamentals** or **technicals** — or a blend of both. Each style has strengths and weaknesses.

### Fundamental Analysis

Focuses on economic data such as:
- GDP, inflation, and employment reports  
- Interest rate decisions  
- Political stability  

### Technical Analysis

Relies on:
- Price charts  
- Indicators like RSI, MACD, and moving averages  
- Trendlines and patterns  

**Conclusion**

Smart traders combine both forms of analysis for stronger conviction. Fundamentals provide context; technicals fine-tune entry and exit points.
