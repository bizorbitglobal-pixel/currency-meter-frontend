**Introduction**

Every trader should know their numbers before they click buy or sell.  
A **risk-to-reward calculator** ensures your potential upside justifies your risk — no guessing, no emotions.

### Why It’s Vital

If your average win is 2R and your average loss is 1R, you can win only 40% of the time and still grow.  
The calculator keeps you honest about that math.

### Smart Practice

- Never enter a trade below 1:1.5 R:R.  
- Review your average over 20+ trades.  
- Adjust stops and targets based on pair volatility.

### Hidden Benefit

It changes your *psychology*. Once you think in R-multiples, losses hurt less and consistency becomes fun.
