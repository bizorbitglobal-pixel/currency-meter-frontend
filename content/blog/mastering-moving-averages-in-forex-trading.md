**Introduction**

Moving averages (MAs) are among the simplest yet most powerful indicators for spotting trends and reversals in forex trading.

### Types of Moving Averages

- **Simple Moving Average (SMA):** Equal weight to all periods.  
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** Emphasizes recent price action.  

Learn how to use both effectively at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### Strategies

1. **Crossover Strategy:** Enter when short MA crosses above long MA.  
2. **Dynamic Support/Resistance:** MAs often act as zones of price reaction.  
3. **Trend Filter:** Trade only in the direction of the MA slope.

**Conclusion**

Moving averages help traders simplify decisions and stay aligned with dominant market direction.
