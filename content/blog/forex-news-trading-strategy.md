**Introduction**

News can either be your worst enemy or your best ally.  
Traders who understand *how* to trade around it — instead of avoiding it blindly — gain an edge.

Learn the rhythm of economic events at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### Pre-News Checklist

- Check the **calendar** daily.  
- Identify **high-impact releases** (CPI, NFP, rate decisions).  
- Plan your bias beforehand using the **strength meter**.

### Trading After the Storm

- Wait for spreads to normalize (2–5 mins).  
- Look for **continuation** setups aligned with new data.  
- Don’t fade strong reactions unless price structure agrees.

### Example

If USD strength surges after strong CPI and EUR/USD breaks major support, follow the flow — don’t fight it.
