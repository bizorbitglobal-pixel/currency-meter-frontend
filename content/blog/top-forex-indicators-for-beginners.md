**Introduction**

Forex indicators simplify analysis by providing visual signals about trend direction, strength, and potential reversals.

### Best Indicators to Start With

- **Moving Averages (MA)** – Identify overall trend.  
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** – Measure momentum.  
- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)** – Detect crossovers and reversals.  

Experiment with these at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### How to Use Them

1. Avoid overloading charts with indicators.  
2. Combine with price action.  
3. Always backtest before live trading.  

**Conclusion**

Indicators guide traders — but don’t replace judgment. Use them to confirm what price is already showing.
