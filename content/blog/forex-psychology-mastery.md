**Introduction**

The hardest chart to read is the one inside your head.  
Trading psychology isn’t theory — it’s the difference between *potential* and *profitability*.

You’ll find mindset training resources at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### Why Mindset Matters

Markets don’t punish bad ideas; they punish lack of control.  
Fear closes good trades early. Greed keeps bad ones open.  
Discipline, built through habit, neutralizes both.

### Core Mindset Habits

1. Accept uncertainty — no setup is guaranteed.  
2. Stick to written rules — your plan is your anchor.  
3. Detach from single outcomes — think in series.  
4. Review behavior weekly, not just P&L.

### Thought from Experience

You don’t need more indicators. You need more *emotional repetition* — executing correctly even when it’s uncomfortable.
