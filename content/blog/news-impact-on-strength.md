**Introduction**

News moves currency **baskets**, not just single pairs. That’s why a strength meter reacts instantly to releases like CPI, NFP, or rate decisions: the story changes across the board, and the meter summarizes it in one glance.

Track reaction and follow-through at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### Pre-news checklist

- Know the **time** and **consensus**.  
- Define whether you’ll trade **before**, **after**, or **not at all**.  
- Reduce risk; spreads can widen and slippage increases.

### Post-news play

1. Wait for the **first 1–2 candles** to print; let spreads normalize.  
2. If the meter shows **broad USD strength** and charts confirm lower highs on EUR/USD, look for a clean continuation setup.  
3. Manage the position actively — volatility after news can be stair-steppy.

### Don’t fight the tape

Sometimes the initial spike reverses. If strength flips quickly, accept the narrative change and stand aside until structure is clear again.

### Key takeaway

Let fundamentals set the stage; let the meter tell you how the market *actually* interpreted the story.
