**Introduction**

Forex runs 24 hours, but liquidity and volatility vary drastically.  
Understanding **session overlaps** helps you trade when volume — and opportunity — peak.

Check live session clock tools on [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### Main Sessions

- **Sydney:** quiet, early market tone.  
- **Tokyo:** active for JPY and AUD.  
- **London:** biggest volume globally.  
- **New York:** heavy momentum during overlap.

### Overlap Power

London–New York overlap (13:00–17:00 UTC) sees largest moves.  
If strength meter shows strong USD and weak EUR, EUR/USD trades trend cleanly here.

### Key Tip

Trade when two sessions overlap for volume and clarity — not during rollovers or weekends.
