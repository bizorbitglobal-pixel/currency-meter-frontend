**Introduction**

Every trader needs a well-defined strategy to survive the dynamic forex market. Here are the most effective approaches used by professionals.

### 1. Trend-Following Strategy

Trade in the direction of the prevailing trend.  
**Tools:** Moving averages, trend lines, and currency strength meters.

### 2. Breakout Strategy

Enter trades after price breaks key support or resistance levels.  
**Confirm breakouts** using volume and volatility indicators.

### 3. Range Trading

When markets move sideways, buy low and sell high within a defined range.  
**Watch RSI** for overbought/oversold conditions.

### 4. News Trading

React to major economic releases like NFP or CPI.  
**Tip:** Expect volatility â€” use smaller position sizes.

### 5. Scalping & Intraday Momentum

Execute fast trades based on short-term strength shifts.  
**Tools:** Strength meters, volume indicators, and live data feeds.

**Conclusion**

No strategy fits all. Test, refine, and stick to one that aligns with your risk tolerance and time commitment.
