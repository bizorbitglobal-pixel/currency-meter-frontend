**Introduction**

When price and momentum disagree, something interesting is brewing.  
That’s the essence of **divergence** — and it’s a subtle clue used by experienced traders worldwide.

See divergence cheat sheets at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### Types of Divergence

- **Regular Divergence:** Predicts reversal.  
- **Hidden Divergence:** Suggests trend continuation.

Example: If EUR/USD makes a new high but RSI fails to do the same, momentum is fading — a potential short trigger if strength confirms.

### Strength Meter + Divergence Combo

The meter tells you which side is strong.  
If divergence appears *against* that strength, expect minor pullbacks, not full reversals.  
If both align, that’s your green light.

### Key Tip

Always confirm divergence on at least two timeframes.  
Noise on a single chart can mislead you; context prevents confusion.
