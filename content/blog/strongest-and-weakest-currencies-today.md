**Introduction**

Every trading day, some currencies outperform while others lag behind. Tracking the **strongest and weakest currencies** helps traders find clear directional setups.

### How to Identify Them

Use a **live currency strength meter** to analyze major pairs. It ranks currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, etc.) in real-time based on overall market movement.

### Why It Matters

- Helps select the best pairs to trade.  
- Confirms market bias before entering.  
- Reduces false signals from random volatility.

**Example:**
If EUR is gaining and USD is weakening, EUR/USD long setups are favored.

**Conclusion**

Knowing today’s strongest and weakest currencies allows traders to trade with momentum — not against it.
