**Introduction**

Supply and demand zones are footprints of institutional traders.  
They mark where big orders previously entered. Combine them with a strength meter and you’ve got precision entries with logic behind them.

### Identifying Zones

- **Demand zone:** sharp rally from a base → buyers dominated.  
- **Supply zone:** fast drop after consolidation → sellers dominated.

### How to Trade Them

1. Mark clean zones (2–4 candles base).  
2. Wait for price to revisit the zone.  
3. Confirm strength alignment with direction.  
4. Enter with tight stop beyond the zone.

### Real Edge

Institutions hide in these areas. Following them doesn’t guarantee profits, but it aligns you with the real players.
