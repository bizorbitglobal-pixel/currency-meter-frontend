**Introduction**

Most traders overcomplicate entries — waiting for ten confirmations and still hesitating.  
The trick isn’t to predict the perfect candle; it’s to **align your entry** with the story told by price *and* strength.

You can see tested setups at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### Core Entry Principles

1. **Context first.** The strength meter defines your bias — strong vs. weak currencies.  
2. **Structure second.** Identify higher highs or lower lows.  
3. **Trigger last.** Candlestick confirmation or breakout close.

### My Favorite Setups

- **Break and retest.** Price breaks resistance, strength confirms, and retests that level — simple and reliable.  
- **Momentum candle + strength push.** When both surge together, it’s rarely a coincidence.  
- **Micro pullback.** On M15 charts, small retraces in trend direction offer clean entries.

### Pro Tip

Avoid candle obsession. A hammer in a range means nothing; the same hammer during strength breakout means everything.
