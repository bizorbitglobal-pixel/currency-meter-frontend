**Introduction**

Day trading rewards those who align with **intraday momentum** and manage risk ruthlessly. A currency strength meter gives the first part; your execution gives the second.

See intraday dashboards at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### Intraday plan

1. **Pre-London scan**: shortlist top-vs-bottom currencies.  
2. **Mark levels**: yesterday’s high/low, session open, VWAP (optional).  
3. **Entry**: trade pullbacks or breakouts that align with strength and structure.  
4. **Risk**: fixed stop (0.5%–1% per trade) and a hard daily loss cap.

### Example

Meter shows **USD strong**, **JPY weak**. On USD/JPY M15, price consolidates below a prior high. Breakout occurs during London–NY overlap with rising volume: enter, stop under consolidation, target 1:2 or trail below higher lows.

### Exit tactics

- **Time-based** (flatten near session close).  
- **Structure-based** (exit on lower-high/loss of momentum).  
- **Partial take-profits** to de-risk and let runners work.

### Final note

Speed + structure win. If you’re guessing, you’re late; if you’re planned, you’re early.
