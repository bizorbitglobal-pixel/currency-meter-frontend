**Introduction**

Pivot points act like invisible magnets for price.  
They’re day traders’ favorite reference for quick reaction zones.

Charts and calculators at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### How to Use Them

- **Above pivot:** bias long.  
- **Below pivot:** bias short.  
- Watch R1/S1 for reversals; R2/S2 for extensions.  
- Combine with strength readings for best accuracy.

### Tip

Confluence is king — when pivot, structure, and strength agree, high-probability setups emerge.
