**Introduction**

The **risk-to-reward ratio** is the cornerstone of profitable forex trading. Knowing how much you risk compared to potential gain helps you plan better trades.

2. Use consistent position sizing.

**Conclusion**

Discipline plus proper ratios equal steady growth. Use calculators to stay objective in every trade.
