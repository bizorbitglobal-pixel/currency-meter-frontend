**Introduction**

Volatility defines opportunity — and danger. The **currency strength meter** shows direction, but **volatility** defines timing.  
If you learn to respect volatility, you’ll avoid overtrading quiet markets and overleveraging wild ones.

Learn volatility-based trade management at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### How to Measure Volatility

The simplest method is **Average True Range (ATR)**. It measures how much a pair moves on average over a set number of candles.  
For example, if ATR(14) on GBP/JPY H1 is 40 pips, expect that typical range per hour.

### Why It Matters

- **High volatility** = wide stops, bigger potential, lower precision.  
- **Low volatility** = tight stops, slow movement, lower risk-reward.  
- Adjust your **position size** and **take profit** based on volatility, not emotion.

### Volatility + Strength Example

If GBP shows strong on the meter and volatility spikes, expect momentum trades.  
If volatility drops but GBP remains strong, expect slow grind trends — ideal for scaling in.

**Conclusion**

Respect volatility like weather. The strength meter is your compass; volatility is your forecast.
