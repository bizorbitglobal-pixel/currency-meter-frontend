**Introduction**

Scalping is adrenaline trading — quick decisions, tighter margins, sharper focus.  
But without discipline, speed kills.

Short-term tactics at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### Golden Rules

1. Trade liquid sessions only (London/NY).  
2. Aim for 5–10 pips per trade.  
3. Stop out fast; don’t hope.  
4. Let strength guide bias — no guessing.

### Edge Tip

Combine the **currency strength meter** with micro-structure like order blocks or EMAs.  
That’s precision, not luck.
