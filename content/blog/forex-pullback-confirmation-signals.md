**Introduction**

Trading pullbacks isn’t about buying dips blindly — it’s about waiting for *confirmation* that momentum wants to continue.  
This is where reading structure and strength together pays off.

Practical walkthroughs at [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### Typical Confirmation Signs

1. **Rejection wick** at prior structure.  
2. **Strength meter** still showing same directional bias.  
3. **Volume uptick** during the return move.  
4. **EMA cross or bounce** near the pullback zone.

### Example

USD strong, JPY weak, USD/JPY trending up.  
You wait for a pullback to previous support, see a bullish engulfing candle, and the meter confirms USD strength → clean long setup.

### Why It Works

Because you’re aligning structure, timing, and flow — the holy trinity of precision trading.
