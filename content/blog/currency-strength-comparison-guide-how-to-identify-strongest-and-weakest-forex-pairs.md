**Introduction: Why Comparing Currency Strengths Matters in Forex Trading**

One of the most common questions forex traders ask is:  
👉 *“Which currency pair should I trade today?”*  

The answer lies in understanding **currency strength comparison** — analyzing which currencies are strong and which are weak. By combining a **[Currency Strength Meter](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com)** with **technical indicators**, you can identify high-probability trade setups every single day.

**What Is Currency Strength Comparison?**

Currency strength comparison shows how individual currencies perform against one another.  
For instance, if USD is strong and JPY is weak, the USD/JPY pair is likely in an uptrend.  
This approach helps you avoid sideways markets and focus on high-momentum opportunities.

It’s one of the most accurate ways to **filter trades** before execution.

**💡 How to Use Currency Strength Comparison in Trading**

1. **Identify the strongest and weakest currencies.**  
   Focus on pairs with at least a 3-point difference in strength — for instance, USD (9.1) vs JPY (2.3).

2. **Check price action and trend direction.**  
   Confirm the bias using moving averages or trendlines — you can learn this in our  
   ➡️ [Forex Moving Averages Guide](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com/blog/forex-moving-averages-guide).

3. **Combine with support/resistance levels.**  
   Strength data becomes powerful when it aligns with clear technical zones.

4. **Avoid correlated trades.**  
   Don’t open multiple trades with similar exposure (e.g., USD/JPY and USD/CHF simultaneously).

5. **Monitor real-time updates.**  
   Currency strength shifts quickly — use [Currency Strengths Meters](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com) for live readings.
