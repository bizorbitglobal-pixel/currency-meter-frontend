**Introduction**

Multi-timeframe analysis bridges the gap between **big-picture bias** and **precise execution**. A strength meter gives the macro context; the chart gives your micro entry.

See multi-timeframe templates on [www.currencystrengthsmeters.com](https://www.currencystrengthsmeters.com).

### Three-Step Approach

1. **Top timeframe (Daily or 4H)** — identify direction using the strength meter and structure.  
2. **Middle timeframe (1H)** — spot pullbacks and continuation levels.  
3. **Entry timeframe (15M)** — execute with tight stops at confluence zones.

### Benefits

- Avoids trading counter to macro trend.  
- Helps refine entry risk.  
- Aligns your trades with the overall market rhythm.

### Example

If USD is strong daily and EUR weak, look for EUR/USD short setups.  
On H4, confirm lower highs.  
On M15, enter after rejection candle or micro double top.

### Summary

Multiple timeframes = multiple confirmations. It’s like zooming in and out of the same truth.
